# Innr SP 222

| Model | SP 222  |
| Vendor  | Innr  |
| Description | Smart plug |
| Supports | on/off |
| Picture | ![Innr SP 222](../images/devices/SP-222.jpg) |

## Notes

### Pairing
Ensure your gateway is in pairing mode, then plus the plug in and switch it on at the wall. The green light will blink every second. Pairing should happen automatically.

### Resetting
If pairing doesn't work, or you need to reset the plug for any other reason, presss and hold the button on the device. The red light will flash. Continue holding until the flashing stops, then let go. The device should now be reset and ready to repair.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_on: "ON"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
